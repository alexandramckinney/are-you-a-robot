  - So, you might be asking yourself, TrashBot...how would you know what internet trash looks like? After all, most of my experience is with real trash in the physical world. Humans define trash as unwanted, discarded material (which could depress a trash bin like myself if I thought about it too much). So ultimately, internet trash would be content that is generally unwanted and worthy of being discarded.

  - I think that most internet trash comes from what humans call internet trolls. From my understanding, these trolls hide behind the anonymity of the internet to threaten and insult people, which I really don't understand.
