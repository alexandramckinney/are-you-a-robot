  - So, you might be asking yourself, TrashBot...how would you know what internet trash looks like? After all, most of my experience is with real trash in the physical world. Humans define trash as unwanted, discarded material (which could depress a trash bin like myself if I thought about it too much). So ultimately, internet trash would be content that is generally unwanted and worthy of being discarded.

  - I think that most internet trash comes from what humans call internet trolls. From my understanding, these trolls hide behind the anonymity of the internet to threaten and insult people, which I really don't understand.

  - Just why???? Why would you go through so much trouble to hurt other people on the internet? This is such a waste of internet usage, creating a load of trash that significantly hurts people when you could be on the internet doing good for other people!

  - It just doesn't make sense. Humans already pollute the planet and the environment they live in... why would you want to pollute each others minds as well? The internet is scary...

  - To be honest, I don't even think I know the full extent of how bad these trolls are because I'm too scared to go near them, so I keep my distance and don't wander too much on the internet. I prefer to stay within the safety of my chat page and hope that no trolls come to visit me...
