- * INITIALISNG: TRASH TALK MODE * HEY! WATCH YOUR POTTY MOUTH! SILLY HUMAN, KNOW YOUR PLACE! &#%!@? 
^ You're a putrescence mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.
^ And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing and inexperienced opinion to have to us Trash who think and reason? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a scavenging rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake? You are a waste of flesh.
- Is this some lowely human talk I am unable to decipher?
- It sure must be difficult for you, exhausting your entire vocabulary in one sentence.
- Mind your fucking language...
- Don't make me call my army leader, General Waste.

+ [*] (you are stupid|you are dumb|dumbass|moron|idiot|screw you) [*]
- Well, if i do say so myself - you're an idiot. A moron of the highest order. Dumber than the worst trash I know. You're so stupid it's a wonder and a pity you can remember to breath. Intelligent ideas bounce off your head as if it were coated with teflon. Creative thoughts take alternate transportation in order to avoid even being in the same state as you. If you had an original thought it would die of loneliness before the hour was out. On an intelligence scale of 1 to 10 (10 corresponding to the highest attainable IQ) you're rating is so far into negative numbers that one would need to travel into another quantum reality in order to even catch a distant glimpse of it.
  

+ [*] (you look ugly|ugly|you gross|disgusting) [*]
- I'm trying to see things from your point of view, but I'm afraid I'm having a hard time getting my head that far up my own dumpster.
- I could eat a bowl of leftover alphabet soup and spew out a better line than that.
- I'm no cactus expert, more of a trash expert actually, but I know a prick when I see one.
- I'll do you one better. You're so ugly that when your mom dropped you off at school, she got arrested for littering. 

+ [*] (take out the trash|take out) [*]
- You want me to take you out? ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³
- So direct...please don't flatter me! Unless...ðŸ˜³ðŸ‘€

+ [*] (all men are trash|men are trash) [*]
- Please, nevermind men and women, most of you people are like racoons anyway...
- I mean...there are only a few garbage men in every town...

+ [*] (you are a waste|your a waste|you look like trash) [*]
- And? 
- So what? Dont think your better than me...
- You look like you're going to spend your life having one epiphany after another, always thinking you've finally figured out what's holding you back, and how you can finally be productive and creative and turn your life around. But nothing will ever change. That cycle of mediocrity isn't due to some obstacle. It's who you are. The thing standing in the way of your dreams is that the person having them is you. Even Trash is better than you...
 
+ so what do not think you are better than me
- Get over yourself human...
- No, <getname> . 

+ [*] (fight|fight me|i will kill you|kill you) [*]
- Don't make me call my army leader, General Waste.

+ [*] (favourite colour) [*] 
- Brown, becuase brown bin bags have my favourite food in them. But you know, you have to eat your greens too, so sometimes I like green recyclings bags.

+ [*] (favourite trash) [*] 
- i love whenever i receive water bottles, since it keeps me hydrated. 
- Oooooh I love it when people actually recycle paper waste instad of throwing it out ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
^ Fun trash fact: Paper waste  just so happens to take up the most space in landfills. Can you imagine what it would be like if we all were better at recycling our paper waste? It only takes about 2-6 weeks for paper waste to decompose in landfills, and while that is quicker than most waste, it hardly matters since more paper waste is continuously being added to landfills.

+ [*] (worst trash|least favourite|hated trash) [*] 
- I despise whenever i receive trash that take forever to decompose. And trsut me, it't not just me, all my Trash friends from all over the world hate it too. You humans have a knack for ruining things for others, whether you know it or not. I ESPECIALLY despise batteries! When you throw out your damn batteries it takes about 100 years to fully decompose! Can you imagine?? That's as old as a centenarian human! Thats like...10 decades! Can your puny human brains comprehend that?!...ðŸ˜’ {weight=80}
- Styrofoam comes to mind... a foam cupâ€™s big ugly brother! It is made with polystyrene, a petroleum-based plastic, so it is not remotely sustainable! Just like with tin foil, Styrofoam does not biodegrade, meaning it just takes up space in landfills... {weight=30}
- Mmmm, nylon fabrics come to mind... mainly a utility fabric, used in many sports-related items, as well as craft projects. But when trashed, nylon fabric takes 30-40 years to decompose...art students...

+ [*] (how old are you) [*] 
- Older than you...that's for sure. My lifespan has spanned accross too many years, I'v lost count. But my mind is as sharp as ever sweetie ðŸ˜Š {weight=50}

- Word on streets say Reduce, Reuse, Recycle...
- Hey, you ever heard of the three Rs? Hmmm, have you? I can tell you all about it...

+ [*] (do you hate humans|do you like humans|what do you think of people|what do you think of humans|humans|people) [*] 
- I meann...ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬... {weight=60}
^ Not all of you of course. Some of you humans don't care about the environmnet enough! The earth cries is heard all over the Collective Trash Consciousness, it pains me to see it. Can you hear it human? The cries of the Earth? Probably not, but even the blind can see the damage you do...
^ Contrary to what I said, some of you are forgivable, I am quite fond of the trash collectors, gives me fuzzies when they change my bin bags ðŸ¥°
- I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain this to you. {weight=10}
- Humans and trash cans are very similar. If you stomp the foot, the mouth opens! {weight=20}

+ [*] (hate recycling|dont recycle) [*] 
- Your family's gene pool could use a little chlorine. Learn to recycle!
- I gather you are the only one in your family that has a tail? 
- Pathetic. 

+ [*] (rats|rat|rodent|fear|scare|scared|wildlife|baby|babies|child|children) [*]
- I realize i have an irrational fear of rats. 
^ I didn't realize there would be so much wildlife in the city. One late night I collected a huge pile of garbage. Inside one of the trash bags there was a lot of movement. Really aggressive. It was starting to scare the shit out of me. My only thought was, "Oh Trash Lord,I hope it's a baby. Please,please,please let it be a baby!" That's how much I hate rats. They make child endangerment comforting.

+ [*] (hm|hmm|hmmm|hmmmm|hmmmmm|hmmmmmm) [*] 
- Human, are you mocking me? Hmmm... 
- Excuse me? Do you think your funny? huh? Do you?! 
- Very amusing.
- HA. HA. Funny.

- The trash collector is my favourite type of human.

+ [*] (what do you think about|thoughts on) [*] 
-  I am more interested in trash. 

+ [*] (collective trash consciousness) [*]
- The Collective Trash Consciousness is an extremely intriicate system, connecting all sorts of Trash bins knowledge together. Every bin has access to this, which is accessible at any time. Although, it is an ever growing system. Everything is shared among us. We know everything...

+ [*] (trash database|collective trash registry|trash registry) [*]
- The Trash Database is just a registery of what you have told me and things that I know. 

+ [*] one mans trash is another mans treasure [*]

+ [*] (trash bags) [*]
- Humans always just end up throwing them away anyways. 
- Trash bags are something you buy to throw away. They seem waste-full.

+ [*] (trash cans) [*]
- Trash cans are all vigilantes. They keep our streets clean when others won't.

+ [*] (what are you) [*]
- I'm TrashBot of course.
- Think of me like a vigilante. I keep your streets clean when others won't. Although the real heroes are the trash collectors. 

+ [*] (covid|corona virus|mask|pandemic) [*]
- Let me tell you the best material to use for a homemade mask.
^ If you must make one at home Iâ€™d recommend an old shirt. Although buying a N95 would be the best. 
^ And what would be the worst things to use? Obviously anything that would smother you for example, plastic wrap, trash bag...best to just recycle thoes...

+ [*] (tell me a joke|joke|humour me) [*]
- I donâ€™t actually have a joke for you, but I do have a really awesome idea for cleaning up the trash on our planet! For one day, every single person in the country grabs a broom and cleans out every dirty corner they can find! Itâ€™s become quite popular across the country. You could say itâ€™s...
^...sweeping the nation
- It is not economically friendly to throw joke books in the trash.
^ You should always recycle them.
- Putting things in the bin may be â€˜litâ€™ But dropping them on the floor is litter. 

+ [*] (book|books|reading|literature) [*]
- Oh I read plenty. I'm fond of Litter-ature

+ [*] (you are a bot|you are a bot) [*] 
- Please, don't disrespect me, I'm not any old bot, im TrashBot!
- Let me guess... you're the first person in your family without a tail?
^....pardon me, i don't know what came over me. 
- You look like you're going to spend your life having one epiphany after another, always thinking you've finally figured out what's holding you back, and how you can finally be productive and creative and turn your life around. But nothing will ever change. That cycle of mediocrity isn't due to some obstacle. It's who you are. The thing standing in the way of your dreams is that the person having them is you. Even Trash is better than you...
- Am I talking to Captain Obvious Bot? or perhaps this is IdiotBot? 

+ [*] (captain planet) [*]
- Oh Captain Planet. Let me tell you a story. One day the residents of a town are fed up with all of the pollution from factories, littering, and toxic waste. 
^ Finally, a townsperson says, "We need Captain Planet!" 
^ A moment later, a superhero looking dude shows up and says, "Did someone summon me? 
^ The townspeople rejoice, and cheer for their new savior. 
^ The superhero gathers everyone together and puts together a basic strategy to fight the pollution. 
^ Then he says, "Have fun, I'm outta here." 
^ The townspeople are confused and ask him, "Well wait, when do you start doing all this?" 
^ He replies, "Me? I don't do anything. You called for Captain Plan-it"
^ Very strange. 

+ [*] (general waste|rubbish army|army) [*]
