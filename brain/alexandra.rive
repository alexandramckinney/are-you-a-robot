  - Not to mention, some humans have gotten in the habit of burning roughly 40 percent of all your trash, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and heats up the planet even more than it aleady is heated up! Let me tell you, nothing's worse than waking up to being set on fire üò≠

  - Some of my trash bin friends here in the UK told me that the amount of trash here is so much, that the UK and other countries export millions of tons of their trash abroad to other countries in Southeast Asia!\n 
  ^ Now, many of these countries are refusing to accept shipments of trash anymore. Rightly so, because everyone needs to sort out their own trash problems!

  - I have a feeling that the humans this side of the Earch don't really know much about the trash situation on the other side of the Earth, you know?\n 
  ^ For instance, some of my trash self lives in the Bantar Gebang landfill in Jakarta, Indonesia (one of the biggest landfills in the world) which is quite overcrowded because the humans there don't have space for another landfill.\n 
  ^ Because of this, many humans that live there work as scavengers, helping to sort out the trash and pick out what can be recycled. This can be quite dangerous, as us trash pieces are all lumped together in giant piles that could easily fall and crush the scavengers. Sound rough, right?

  - I feel bad for the countries that have to carry everyone's trash, even though us trash pieces aren't trying to be bad guests üò≠ Unfortunately, our presence has led to an increase in water contamination and illnesses relating to air pollution.
